# input-viewer
## Description
I wanted to make a browser app that would show the sequence of keys pressed, the way fighting games show them in training mode.

## Run
[Click here](https://thodwrisk.github.io/input-viewer/) to watch it in action

Press keys on your keyboard to see what happens.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project has long been abandoned,
as I lacked basic knowledge of the stack used.
